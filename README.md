| **Dive into Machine Learning: Learning by Implementing** | This tutorial offers an immersive exploration of the world of machine learning. Our primary goal is to demystify complex concepts, presenting them in a simplified manner. We adopt an interactive approach, fostering a gradual and intuitive understanding that enables learners to construct their very first machine-learning model step by step. |

| **Machine Learning for Biology: Learning the Language of Life** | In this tutorial we invite you to explore the language of proteins using machine learning. You don't require any previous bio experience, just some basic python, machine learning knowledge, and a curious spirit! We will be working with cutting edge techniques in protein language modelling, such as using large language models to compute embeddings, how to visualise and explore these embeddings, and finally you will have a chance to train your own model! |
